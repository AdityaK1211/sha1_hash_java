# SHA-1
SHA-1 or Secure Hash Algorithm 1 is a cryptographic hash function which takes an input and produces a 160-bit (20-byte) hash value. This hash value is known as a message digest. This message digest is usually then rendered as a hexadecimal number which is 40 digits long. It is a U.S. Federal Information Processing Standard and was designed by the United States National Security Agency.

Though SHA-1 is still widely used, cryptanalysts in 2005 were able to find vulnerabilities on this algorithm that detrimentally compromised its security. These vulnerabilities came in the form of an algorithm that speedily finds collisions with different inputs, meaning that two distinct inputs map to the same digest.

As of 2010, many organizations have recommended its replacement by SHA-2 or SHA-3.
